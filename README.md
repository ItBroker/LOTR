# LOTR
It will be a LOTR2D pixel game with interesting story . I use C++ with SDL2 library 
and now im gonna make a game engine for my game with ECS design pattern . I wanna create a game not only for adding 
in my future portfolio but for fun:) At the end of the game, the name of each developer, 
sound editor or designer will be highlighted. Don't waste time :)
